## Join the Reactiflux Army

[Reactiflux](http://reactiflux.com) is a great place for all React / Flux / etc... related help, discussions, and complaints. But through our transition from 2 to 7500 people, we've run into some very frustrating growing pains:

1. Our landing page is not stable. It goes down almost daily. And doesn't work with every email addresses. Let's put together a fresh design and make joining Reactiflux possible every minute of the day. 
2. We talk a lot, and Slack has a 10,000 message limit for it's archive. Unless we start paying $100K / year, the issue isn't going away anytime soon. We've talked about building our own searchable archive for months. It shouldn be very difficult with Slack's API. 

So let's work together and build some nice React apps to solve our problems. 

Here's a list of people who have expressed interested in helping out:
