## Join the Reactiflux Army

[Reactiflux](http://reactiflux.com) is a great place for all React / Flux / etc... related help, discussions, and complaints. But through our transition from 2 to 7500 people, we've run into some very frustrating growing pains:

1. Our landing page is not stable. It goes down almost daily. And doesn't work with every email addresses. Let's put together a fresh design and make joining Reactiflux possible every minute of the day. ([join the discussion](https://github.com/reactiflux/www/issues/1))
2. We talk a lot, and Slack has a 10,000 message limit for it's archive. Unless we start paying $100K / year, the issue isn't going away anytime soon. We've talked about building our own searchable archive for months. It shouldn be very difficult with Slack's API. ([join the discussion](https://github.com/reactiflux/www/issues/2))

We've thought about migrating to other products ([join the discussion](https://github.com/reactiflux/volunteers/issues/17)), and believe Slack is the best despite these shortcomings. 

So let's work together and build some nice React apps to solve our problems!
